# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Model-to-Predict-the-Placement-Status-of-Student

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Model to Predict the Placement Status of Student.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import Required Libraries
2. Load the Dataset
3. Copy Data & Drop Unwanted Columns
4. Check Data Quality
5.  Encode Categorical Variables
6.  Define Features (X) and Target (y)
7.  Split into Training and Testing Sets
8. Build and Train Logistic Regression Model
9. Make Predictions
10.  Evaluate the Model
11.   Predict for a New Student
